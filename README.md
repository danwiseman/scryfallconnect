# Introduction

This is a Kafka Connect Plugin for Pulling MTG cards from the ScryFall API. It's mostly a development exercise, but it would allow
easy ingestion of cards into a database or other applications.

# Running in development

The DockerFile works for testing this connect plug in. Run ```run.sh``` to test.

# Not Affiliated

I'm not affiliated with Scryfall nor Wizards of the Coast. Be nice to this API. :grin:
